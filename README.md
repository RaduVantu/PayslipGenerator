<h2> Payslip Generator </h2>

<h3> Description </h3>

<p>The idea here was to develop a console based Payroll System for a small company with employees working on different contract types: salaried (with part time or full time option), commissioned and hourly contract employees. Each employee's personal information, such as Employee ID, title, first name, last name, national insurance Number, etc. must also be stored.</p>
<p>The program should generate and display the monthly payslip for each employee, based on employee ID and relevant parameters (for hourly employee the number of hours for example).</p>
<p>The navigation should be done using the number or letter assigned to each menu/sun-menu option  as shown below: </p>
<ol>
  <li>Register Employee</li> 
  <p> a) Salaried Employee</br>
    b) Hourly Employee</br>
    c) Commission Employee</p>
  <li>View Employee</li>
  <p> a) All Employees</br>
    b) Salaried Employees</br>
    c) Hourly Employees</br>
    d) Commission Employee</p>
  <li>Remove Employee</li>
  <li>Generate Pay slips</li>
  <p> a) Salaried Employee</br>
    b) Hourly Employee</br>
    c) Commission Employee</p>
  <li>Exit</li>    
</ol>
